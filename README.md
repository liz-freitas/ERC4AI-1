# ERC4AI

ERC4AI is a tool developed to classify software requirements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems based on ethical principles. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, it allows both binary classification, determining whether a requirement is related to AI ethics, and multi-label classification, associating requirements with one or more ethical principles.
